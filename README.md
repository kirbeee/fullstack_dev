# Emaily
This is a project that I have built for the course of the Full Stack Web Development on Udemy. This project is a web application that allows users to send surveys to their customers. The users can create a survey and send it to their customers. The customers can answer the survey and the users can see the results of the survey. The users can also see the list of the surveys that they have sent and the results of the surveys.
